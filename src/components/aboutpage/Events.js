//             Each year, our team holds several events for all members to take apart in.
//             Below you can find a list of all of them that we plan to have every single year!

//         <p className='event-name'>School Meets</p>
//         <p className='event-description'>
//             Each quarter, we aim to hold 2 or more meets, sometimes even trimeets. Each school team
//             sends in a team ranking and a roster list, where members with the same rankings in their
//             respective events play against each other for points. Most points out of the schools wins!
//             The Badminton Club at UC Davis will host these meets sometimes, but we also take team trips
//             to other colleges and gyms to be hosted!

//         <p className='event-name'>Weekly Practices</p>
//         <p className='event-description'>
//             Each week, the BCUCD holds 3 practices in an open gym style. Each court has its own system of play
//             to accomodate for every level of play. From challenge courts for people to challenge higher level
//             players to open gym signup style courts for beginners to play, all levels of players get a chance
//             to play! Birds are given out to all members per match, with safety officers and other officers there
//             to supervise conduct and play.

//         <p className='event-name'>Bonding Events</p>
//         <p className='event-description'>
//             To push members to meet and bond with each other, our event coordinators create many opportunities inside
//             and outside badminton for members to come and meet each other! Events that we have created in the past 
//             include a Six Flags trip, MU Game Room trips, group Karaoke, Night Market, and so much more.

//         <p className='event-description'>
//             Beginning in 2024, California has been invited to participate in the USA Badminton Collegiate Nationals, 
//             hosted in Boston. Two times a year, we participate in a Northern California Regional Tournament to 
//             fight for 1 of 3 spots to represent NorCal at the nationals. We are reigning regional champions this year, and 
//             are pushing to defend our titles next year!

//         <p className='event-name'>Irvine Trip</p>
//         <p className='event-description'>
//             A longstanding tradition of this club is to take a team road trip to Irvine to participate in the annual Irvine 
//             collegiate tournament! By coordinating travel plans, AirBnBs and food accomodations, we want this trip to be a 
//             core memory for all members of our club. Members tend to split into groups to participate in the tournament, or
//             to explore the city, and come back to reconvene with everyone for night bonding activities!

//         <p className='event-name'>UC Davis Interclub Tournaments</p>
//         <p className='event-description'>
//             Every year, we like to host a UC Davis exclusive tournament as practice for our largest tournament, the Davis Open.
//             A fun and competitive event, we encourage members to take this opportunity to play with new partners and even new
//             events to have fun against their friends. We open this tournament to any Davis student, with a low cost entree free
//             to pay for fun prizes, including stuffed animals as trophies and stickers!

//         <p className='event-description'>
//             At the end of the year, the club hosts a member-exclusive year-end banquet to commemorate the memories and friends 
//             made throughout the year. Catered by restaurants like Panda Express, Chipotle, or Guads Tacos & Beer, it is a celebratory
//             event that all members come formally dressed to attend. Events include saying goodbye to graduating members, unveiling new
//             officers, and presenting superlatives.
